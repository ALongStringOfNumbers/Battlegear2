[font=Helvetica, arial, freesans, clean, sans-serif][color=#333333]This is the second iteration of Mine & Blade: Battlegear, the popular dual-wielding and combat mod for Minecraft. This iteration will be opensource with multiple modders contributing. There is currently [/color][/font][color=#ff0000][font=Helvetica, arial, freesans, clean, sans-serif][b]no download available[/b][/font][/color][font=Helvetica, arial, freesans, clean, sans-serif][color=#333333].[/color][/font]

Any person doing the following will be reported[list]
[*]Asking for an update or asking when a download will be available (update pestering)
[list]
[*]If you really want to get an idea of the complexity of what we are doing look at [url="http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1722960-wip-mine-blade-battlegear-2-modders-discussions/page__st__100__gopid__21460802#entry21460802"]this post[/url]. But please do not ask for a release date, it is far to early and we have far too much work to give a reliable date
[/list][*]Posting pointless comments such as "Yay this was my favourite mod" (spam)
[list]
[*]I know people will be excited, but these sort of comments add nothing to the discussion and just get in the way of the massive amount of work required
[/list]
[/list]
Also I request [b]please do not ask about compatibility[/b]. It is far to early to know, and most of the time I will not be able to tell you unless I can see the source code (so bug other modders to make their mods opensource)


We are currently working on the dual wielding functionality of the mod.

So far the following works[list]
[*] Dual wielding of weapons and fists
[*] Switching between normal and battlemode with the 'R' Key
[*] Attacking entities with both the offhand and mainhand weapons
[*] Rendering of dual wielding in 1st person view
[*] 3rd person renderering
[*] Initial work on the equip screen
[*] Inital work on an API to allow other modders to define dual wielding weapons
[*] Swinging of offhand items of other players
[*] Rendering of offhand weapons on other players
[*] Basic Shift Clicking on the inventory screen
[*] Initial Configuration Files
[*] Basic Heraldry
[*] Inital work on the following weapons: waraxe, dagger
[/list]

So far the following still needs to be done[list]
[*] (Most) ASM capabilities*
[*] Rendering of sheathed weapons
[*] Spear & Mace
[*] Shields
[/list]
The code is available on my personal gitnub account [url="https://github.com/amedw/Battlegear2"]here[/url].
Due to potential legal issues involved in the re-distribution of minecraft's code, all base class edits are distributed as .patch files. I have provided installation instructions and scripts to simplify the installation and retrieval of the source code.
